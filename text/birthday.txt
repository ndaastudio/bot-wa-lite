Hey there! How's it going?

*Happy birthday!* I hope you have an absolute blast today, filled with all the things that make you grin from ear to ear. May this year bring you some epic adventures, loads of new experiences, and total success in everything you set your mind to.

Even though we've gone our separate ways, I want you to know that I cherish the memories we made together. Let this special day serve as a reminder of the awesome times we had and the personal growth we went through.

Here's to another year of kicking it, finding your bliss, and making those dreams of yours come true. Enjoy your day surrounded by your loved ones who truly dig you. You deserve all the happiness this world has to offer.

Once again, *happy birthday!* Wishing you nothing but the raddest things in life.

Warm regards,
*Secret*
